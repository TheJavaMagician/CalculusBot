# CalculusBot
Discord Bot Built in Java using (Javacord) library

The software is still a work in progress but is very much functional. Using maven framework this 
software has bot administration and standard commands for a variety of uses within discord.

Due to certain commands such as "System and Faction" the Calculus bot is more suited to discords which make use of the game Elite: Dangerous. This is because this software makes use of community API's associated with the game.

This software has been built using the JavaCord library and acknowledges its conditions for use
